Expense Insight is a small program to help notify you of your spending via a short weekly SMS message. Built with Plaid & Twilio, utilising AWS for timers, functions & storage, the app will give you a weekly text message of your spend for a provided account. At the same point you can adjust your target for the upcoming week or leave it as is.
